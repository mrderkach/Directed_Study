Today the fertility level in China is around 1.7 children per woman. if China were to relax its one-child policy, then it's reasonable to expect that fertility would rise. If fertility increased to replacement level of 2.1 (an increase of just under a half a child), which is not unreasonable given desired family size, the country's annual number of births would increase by nearly 30 percent, or approximately five million additional births. By midcentury, this would add up to nearly a quarter-billion more Chinese than currently projected by the U.N.</t>

        <t id="8">"One child" is only partly responsible for reducing China's fertility rates. The most dramatic decrease in the rate actually occurred before the policy was imposed. Between 1970 and 1979, the largely voluntary "late, long, few" policy, which called for later childbearing, greater spacing between children, and fewer children, had already resulted in a halving of the total fertility rate, from 5.9 to 2.9. After the one-child policy was introduced, there was a more gradual fall in the rate until 1995, and it has more or less stabilized at approximately 1.7 since then.</t>
